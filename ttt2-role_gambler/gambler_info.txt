Reworked to instead of giving you a random amount of equipment items upon spawn,
you now get an exclusive weapon that lets you throw a suitcase forwards
that gives you a random non-passive equipment item from the traitor shop.
Regenerates ammo every 30 seconds, can hold up to 5.

Comes with a convar to control how much armor it starts with.

Bugs:
Does not display ammo gain for suitcase upon regenerating a new one, meaning that you'll have to manually check for ammo gain.
