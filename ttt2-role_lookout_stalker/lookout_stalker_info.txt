Lookout and Stalker, a modified version of https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1921866317

Uses a Detective Playercam and Camera to track players.

Originally was a Detective role, but was moved to innocents since it was deemed to not be strong as having a DNA scanner.
To compensate, Stalker was created to make sure that the Lookout was not instantly proven.

Stalker icon is from https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2755155854
